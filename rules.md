# Transit: A microRPG about digression, loss, and public transportation.

## Introduction

Mirage lines shimmer over a stretch of pavement that stretches from horizon to horizon. A well-worn bus sputters along the highway in no particular hurry. A plume of black smoke errupting from the bus' hood precludes its coasting to a halt. A middle-aged man leads a group of passengers to the front of the bus and scrathes his head before sending a group of passengers out to find yet another replacement part for the bus.

### Themes in Transit

As seen in the subtitle, <span class="transit">Transit</span> is a game about digression, loss, and public transportation. I want to take a moment to break down what these themes mean to the game.

#### digression

In <span class="transit">Transit</span> everybody (except for the Bus Driver) is trying to get somewhere. They may be anxious to arrive as quickly as possible, or content to take as long to get somewhere as possible. Some passengers might not even know where they're going — just that they'll know it when they see it. This is not a game about getting to you r destination. This is a game about what happens on the journey. I concieve of <span class="transit">Transit</span> as a kind of monster-of-the-week game, where every session the passengers are confronted with yet another digression to deal with before they can continue on their journey.

#### loss

Over the course of <span class="transit">Transit</span>'s many diversions, passengers will loose a lot. Sometimes the loss will be literal, taking the form of items, health, or even lives. Sometimes the loss will go deeper; a passenger might exit a diversion a changed person, 'loosing' the person they were along the way. This means that in many ways <span class="transit">Transit</span> is a tragedy, always bringing a cost to passenger victory that might often border on Pyhrric. 

#### public transportation

<span class="transit">Transit</span> is not a bummer. Despite passengers loosing something as a rule, they're still consistantly encountering some outright *weird* stuff! Public translation may not be as much of a literal theme as Digression and Loss, but its inclusion is meant to represent to add a bit of weird to the game. My original pitch to my principle collaborator was: *Transit: A microRPG about digression, loss, and public transportation. Players are passengers on a bus line that crawls over America's vast intrastate highway networks and have adventures every time the bus breaks down, stops for fuel, or gets buzzed by a cryptid with a machine gun.* and a crucial part of that pitch was the inclusion of the whimsically weird "cryptid with a machine gun." Public Transportation means to remember to have fun, don't let 'serious-ness' overwhelm the game, it's only a third of the themes, after all!

### How Things are Layed out

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## Passengers

<span class="transit">Transit</span> might see you play a number of different passengers — all of whom are on the same bus to nowhere plodding about in what might be the least efficient route imaginable. Your passenger, or passengers (more on this later) will all have the following at passenger creation:

| <span class="transit">Item        | <span class="transit">Description</span>                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <span class="transit">Name        | What your passenger calls themself. This might be their given name, a moniker, or a nickname.                                                                         |
| <span class="transit">Destination | Where your passenger is headed. This can be as close to your starting city, or on the other side of the nation. This determines when your passenger gets off the bus. |
| <span class="transit">Facts       | At passenger creation, your passenger has three **facts**: A **personality trait**, a **skill**, and a **relationship**.                                              |
| <span class="transit">Description | A brief bio of your passenger that incorperates their appearnce, their current **facts**, and any other information that helps the table get to know them.            |

You might make two or three passengers to start the game off with, but you will only play one at a time. An example passenger, the Bus Driver, is presented below.
| <span class="transit">Item</span>        | <span class="transit">Description</span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

He doesn't have much in the way of friendships, but he does have a habit of refering to the bus as "Charlotte." |

### passenger Name

Your name says a lot about who your passenger is. "William" sounds like a different kind of person compared to "Bill," and "Ol' Caterwaller" implies something far different than "Mrs. Hancock." Your passenger's name can say as much (or as little) about them as you decide, but it should probably be something that everyone at the table can say with a straight face.

### Destination

<span class="transit">Transit</span> is a game about diversions, but your passenger boarded the bus with the intention of arriving someplace and, sooner or later, they're going to reach their destination. The game starts in Hutchinson, Kansas (Just north of Wichita) and you're free to choose a destination as close or as far away as you'd like. You might even decide to leave the destination blank, playing the role of an aimless drifter who'll know destination when they see it. Longer destinations provide more chances to acculimate **facts**, but it's worth remembering that not all facts will be beneficial! When your passenger reaches their destination, they disembark and you create a new passenger.

<span class="typewriter">Design note: I want the length of the journey -- decided by the number of non-item facts the passenger has at departure -- to help inform the number of facts about their next charcter to keep a sense of progression and reward riskier destinations. On the other hand, I'm also not a huge fan of rewarding players in such a way that, if the game continues long enoguh for one player to get four passengers to their destination, they start a passenger with so many facts that it's hard for that passenger to go someplace; essentially rewarding success with something that isn't very fun.</span>

### Facts

These are the most mechanical elements of your passenger. There aren't pre-defined facts from a lit you can pull from, but sometimes you'll be asked to add or use facts that fit a certian category. Categories might be **personality traits** like "stern like a schoolteacher", "easily distracted", or "goes-with-the-flow;" **relationships** that link passengers together like "dating X" or "Hates Y;"  **skills** like "expert navigator" or "Professional Yo-Yo-er;" or **items** like "baseball bat" or "briefcase."

Some facts might stick around for awhile (like core personality traits), some might get canceled out by future facts ("Dating" would be erased by "Broke Up With"), and some are only around for as long as the passenger has them (if you break your baseball bat, you clearly don't have it anymore!). Facts should toe the line between specificity and generality.

Whenever you're asked to make a roll, you add 1 die to the pool for every relevant fact your passenger possesses that would help you and remove 1 die from the pool for every relevant fact that might get in your way. The GM might even allow you to add additional dice for a fact if it's particularly relevant. For example, Sarah (an out-of-work ranch hand) is trying to climb up a wall. Sarah's player argues that her "cow rustler" and "coil of rope" facts would allow her to toss the rope to a peg at the top of the wall and climb up. The GM agrees, noting that the rope is especially relevant to this situation and decides to grant Sarah's player three die: two for the facts and one bonus die for the relevance of her rope.

### Description

Now that you have a bundle of facts and a pretty decent picture of who this passenger is, it's time to write a brief description. This is for the benefit of everyone at the table — you've got a way of remembering how you're playing the passenger, and everyone else has a way of holding this passenger in their heads. This can be as long or as short as you'd like, but remember that people might respond better to a snappy description rather than a small novella!

## Playing the Game

Often, your passengers will be put in situations where the outcome isn't guaranteed. Maybe you've got to barter for a new tire-iron, or maybe you're running away from a gang of bikers. Whatever the reason for getting *into* a situation, getting out always requires a **roll**.

Rolls follow this procedure: 

1. The GM sets a difficulty for the situation
2. The player assembles a die pool and other passengers decide if they can help out
3. The player rolls the dice and compares the number of successes to the difficulty. 

When your passenger is in a situation, the GM will decide how difficult the resolution to this situation is. Replacing a tire might be easy (a difficulty of **1**), but replacing a tire in the dead of a moonless night after running a marathon to *get* that tire is likely a bit more difficult (probably around the **3-4** range). Once the GM has settled on a difficulty, it's time to build a dice pool.

First, add one die for trying. You always have at least 1 dice in your pool, representing your passenger's general abilities. Next, figure out what facts are relevant to this situation and add  a die for every relevant fact (with bonus dice awarded by the GM for particularly clever or relevant thinking). Finally, one other player might decide to help you, granting you an automatic success for every relevant fact *they* possess.

Once the dice pool is assembled, roll! Every die that comes up with a 5 or a 6 counts as a success. To succeed, you need a number of successes equal to the difficulty of the situation; otherwise you fail. Success usually means that the situation works out in your favor, and failure usually means that the situation works out badly for you.

Keep in mind that some situations might be life and death, but most will not. Some physical situations might result in adding injury facts <span class="typewriter">I really need to expand facts; negative facts probably shouldn't contribute dice</span> or otherwise impeeding your abilities. Not every situation is high-risk, but high-risk situations should be seen as part of the fun!


<span class="typewriter">I might shift how helping works around later; I like the idea of adding flat successess, but I'm worried that it might prevent players from attempting really cool moments of singular triumph. Sure it's a cooperative game, but sometimes a passenger needs to do something by themselves to satisfy their passenger arc and as-written there's nothing to really encourage that. Maybe add a risk/reward method of 'helping' that makes the outcome worse if they got help? Maybe I could have help be a flat sorta mechanic that doesn't add success but instead shifts the success to a 4-6 instead of 5-6. I don't know, we'll have to think about that.</span>
