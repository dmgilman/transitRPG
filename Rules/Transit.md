# Transit: A microRPG about digression, loss, and public transportation.

## Introduction

I'll put more here eventually, but you essentially play the part of a passenger aboard a bus that meanders its way over the American State Highways. A crucial part of <span class="transit">Transit</span> is the diversions that happen along the route of the journey. Flat tires might force characters to go looking for help, a tourist trap might suck the passengers into its clutches, or a roadblock might make the current route unpassable unless the characters do something about it. 

## Characters

<span class="transit">Transit</span> might see you play a number of different characters — all of whom are on the same bus to nowhere plodding about in what might be the least efficient route imaginable. Your character, or characters (more on this later) will all have the following at character creation:

| <span class="transit">Item        | <span class="transit">Description</span>                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <span class="transit">Name        | What your character calls themself. This might be their given name, a moniker, or a nickname.                                                                         |
| <span class="transit">Destination | Where your character is headed. This can be as close to your starting city, or on the other side of the nation. This determines when your character gets off the bus. |
| <span class="transit">Facts       | At character creation, your character has three **facts**: A **personality trait**, a **skill**, and a **relationship**.                                              |
| <span class="transit">Description | A brief bio of your character that incorperates their appearnce, their current **facts**, and any other information that helps the table get to know them.            |

You might make two or three characters to start the game off with, but you will only play one at a time. An example character, the Bus Driver, is presented below.
| <span class="transit">Item</span>        | <span class="transit">Description</span>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| <span class="transit">Description</span> | A middle-aged man whose been on the road for the last twenty years, Jim takes every option to provide his passengers with a valuable service: new experiences! While they aren't always popular, nobody can beat the company's fares, and Jim always manages to get folks to their destination (at least, most of the time...). He doesn't have much in the way of friendships, but he does have a habit of refering to the bus as "Charlotte." |

### Character Name

Your name says a lot about who your character is. "William" sounds like a different kind of person compared to "Bill," and "Ol' Caterwaller" implies something far different than "Mrs. Hancock." Your character's name can say as much (or as little) about them as you decide, but it should probably be something that everyone at the table can say with a straight face.

### Destination

<span class="transit">Transit</span> is a game about diversions, but your character boarded the bus with the intention of arriving someplace and, sooner or later, they're going to reach their destination. The game starts in Hutchinson, Kansas (Just north of Wichita) and you're free to choose a destination as close or as far away as you'd like. You might even decide to leave the destination blank, playing the role of an aimless drifter who'll know destination when they see it. Longer destinations provide more chances to acculimate **facts**, but it's worth remembering that not all facts will be beneficial! When your character reaches their destination, they disembark and you create a new character.

<span class="typewriter">Design note: I want the length of the journey -- decided by the number of non-item facts the character has at departure -- to help inform the number of facts about their next charcter to keep a sense of progression and reward riskier destinations. On the other hand, I'm also not a huge fan of rewarding players in such a way that, if the game continues long enoguh for one player to get four characters to their destination, they start a character with so many facts that it's hard for that character to go someplace; essentially rewarding success with something that isn't very fun.</span>

### Facts

These are the most mechanical elements of your character. There aren't pre-defined facts from a lit you can pull from, but sometimes you'll be asked to add or use facts that fit a certian category. Categories might be **personality traits** like "stern like a schoolteacher", "easily distracted", or "goes-with-the-flow;" **relationships** that link characters together like "dating X" or "Hates Y;"  **skills** like "expert navigator" or "Professional Yo-Yo-er;" or **items** like "baseball bat" or "briefcase."

Some facts might stick around for awhile (like core personality traits), some might get canceled out by future facts ("Dating" would be erased by "Broke Up With"), and some are only around for as long as the character has them (if you break your baseball bat, you clearly don't have it anymore!). Facts should toe the line between specificity and generality.

Whenever you're asked to make a roll, you add 1 die to the pool for every relevant fact your character possesses. The GM might even allow you to add additional dice for a fact if it's particularly relevant. For example, Sarah (an out-of-work ranch hand) is trying to climb up a wall. Sarah's player argues that her "cow rustler" and "coil of rope" facts would allow her to toss the rope to a peg at the top of the wall and climb up. The GM agrees, noting that the rope is especially relevant to this situation and decides to grant Sarah's player three die: two for the facts and one bonus die for the relevance of her rope.

### Description

Now that you have a bundle of facts and a pretty decent picture of who this character is, it's time to write a brief description. This is for the benefit of everyone at the table — you've got a way of remembering how you're playing the character, and everyone else has a way of holding this character in their heads. This can be as long or as short as you'd like, but remember that people might respond better to a snappy description rather than a small novella!

## Playing the Game

Often, your characters will be put in situations where the outcome isn't guarenteed. Maybe you've got to barter for a new tire-iron, or maybe you're running away from a gang of bikers. Whatever the reason for getting *into* a situation, getting out always requires a **roll**.

Rolls follow this procedure: 

1. The GM sets a difficulty for the situation
2. The player assembles a die pool and other characters decide if they can help out
3. The player rolls the dice and compares the number of successes to the difficulty. 

When your character is in a situation, the GM will decide how difficult the resolution to this situation is. Replacing a tire might be easy (a difficulty of **1**), but replacing a tire in the dead of a moonless night after running a marathon to *get* that tire is likely a bit more difficult (probably around the **3-4** range). Once the GM has settled on a difficulty, it's time to build a dice pool.

First, add one die for trying. You always have at least 1 dice in your pool, representing your character's general abilities. Next, figure out what facts are relevant to this situation and add  a die for every relevant fact (with bonus dice awarded by the GM for particularly clever or relevant thinking). Finally, one other player might decide to help you, granting you an automatic success for every relevant fact *they* possess.

Once the dice pool is assembled, roll! Every die that comes up with a 5 or a 6 counts as a success. To succeed, you need a number of successes equal to the difficulty of the situation; otherwise you fail. Success usually means that the situation works out in your favor, and failure usually means that the situation works out badly for you.

Keep in mind that some situations might be life and death, but most will not. Some physical situations might result in adding injury facts <span class="typewriter">I really need to expand facts; negative facts probably shouldn't contribute dice</span> or otherwise impeeding your abilities. Not every situation is high-risk, but high-risk situations should be seen as part of the fun!


<span class="typewriter">I might shift how helping works around later; I like the idea of adding flat successess, but I'm worried that it might prevent players from attempting really cool moments of singular triumph. Sure it's a cooperative game, but sometimes a character needs to do something by themselves to satisfy their character arc and as-written there's nothing to really encourage that. Maybe add a risk/reward method of 'helping' that makes the outcome worse if they got help? Maybe I could have help be a flat sorta mechanic that doesn't add success but instead shifts the success to a 4-6 instead of 5-6. I don't know, we'll have to think about that.</span>
